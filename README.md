# eCommerce-Java
E-commerce encompasses the activities of purchasing and selling products through online services or over the Internet. This form of commerce leverages technologies like mobile commerce, electronic funds transfer, supply chain management, Internet marketing, online transaction processing, electronic data interchange (EDI), inventory management systems, and automated data collection systems. We've harnessed the power of JavaFx to craft an exceptional interface for both customers and the administrative panel. Our aim is to provide a seamless experience for our customers. Additionally, we've integrated various APIs including Mail, JFonex, controllsJFX, MY-SQL-connector, and more.
The primary objective of this design is to create a relational database structure and implement normalization in a methodical manner, ensuring that the database is well-suited for versatile querying and devoid of certain undesirable characteristics. These include anomalies in insertion, update, and deletion that could potentially compromise data integrity.
In our design, we've employed Entities, which are composed of attributes. An attribute represents a characteristic of an entity. Each attribute falls into one of three categories:
1.	Descriptive – An attribute is descriptive if it doesn't serve to identify or relate but is used to illustrate or express a characteristic of an entity occurrence.
2.	Identifying – An attribute that identifies serves as a candidate key. If the value of an identifying attribute changes, it should result in the identification of a different entity occurrence. Such attributes should remain unchangeable and immutable.
3.	Relational – An attribute that establishes relationships between entities is a foreign key. This attribute refers to the primary key attribute of another (or the same) entity occurrence
How does it work :
The process is fairly straightforward. Initially, the customer has the option to either sign up, or if they are already registered, they can simply log in to their account. Following this, all they have to do is select a product and complete the transaction. That's all there is to it for the customer. In contrast, the admin has the capability to log in and gain complete control over the project.
